# Clean Data

This folder will be populated with the following datasets computed while running `data_processing.ipynb`. To avoid running notebook in colab for 30 minutes, you can find the cleaned data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gb3iHnXUXUi64BlI7cqRmAIYz9o4ZS33) in the `clean_data.zip` file:

- `btc.parquet`: contains the bitcoin price evolution aggregate in hour.
- `twitter.parquet`: contains the selected pertinent tweets with their sentiment class.
- `foreign_lang_tweets.parquet`: contains all tweets in foreign language to allow user to check the deleted tweets because of non-english content.
