## Objective for Bitcoin and Twitter Data Analysis (2017–2019)

We propose the following steps for analyzing the correlation between Bitcoin prices and Twitter activity during 2017–2019.  

### 1. Bitcoin Price Analysis  
- **Focus on Returns**: Instead of analyzing the price directly, we will compute Bitcoin returns to identify significant trends and events.  
- **Highlight Big Events**: Identify key moments, such as major price spikes or drops, within the timeframe.  

### 2. Twitter Data Analysis  
- **Define Influential Tweets**: Filter tweets based on defined thresholds (e.g., x likes, replies, or retweets) to focus on medium/highly impactful content.  
- **Language Filter**: Ensure only English tweets are included, as non-English content (~5-10%) can be considered negligible.  
- **Analyze Influence**: Highlight accounts with the highest engagement (likes/retweets) for easier representation in the final visualizations.  

### 3. Cross-Analysis Objective  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate whether:  
  - Bitcoin price events (returns) trigger Twitter discussions, or  
  - Influential tweets anticipate significant Bitcoin price changes.  
- **Effect Duration**: If Twitter is found to influence Bitcoin prices, estimate the duration of this effect.  

The ultimate goal is to determine the direction and strength of this relationship, if any. A sample visualization will illustrate the influence of key accounts and events.
